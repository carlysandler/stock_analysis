# Stock Analysis: Refactoring VBA Macro & Excel Spreadsheet Visualization

## Overview of Project
*Conducting Financial Analysis on Multiple Stock Tickers Through VBA Macro Automation in Excel*
---
### Purpose
The following project involves a deliberate, strategic refactoring of the Stock Market dataset, which utilzes VBA code scripting. The code solution loops through the entirity of the dataset, supported by conditional logic functions (if-then statements), in order to calculate KPI variables in the market that measure the perfromance of a tickerIndex over a given period of time.  These metrics of performance are treated as arrays within the VBA code: tickerVolumes, startingTickerPrices and endingTickerPRices. In this analysis specifically, we are looking to find the annual Return, defined as the variance in stock price within a given year. The exercise of refactoring, or editing the code, is to demontrate the advantages of making the script more efficient--this is done by taking fewer steps to loop through all the data to find the output variables. Conducting a refactoring should in turn make the macro script more reader friendly and use less computer memory; therefore, it should theoretically take Excel a shorter amount of time to run the analysis.

## Analysis and Challenges
The following delinates the process of completing the refactoring of "All Stocks Analysis", defined by the subroutine: "AllStocksAnalysisRefactored"

  - 1) data wrathing of raw population sample through:
     * dynamic formulas using both arithmatic and statistical functions
     * custom sorting, filtering, and conditional formatting for optimal analytical capabilities
     
  - 2) analysis of the modified Kickstarter data set with:
     * pivot tables summarizing the campaign outcomes based on launch date and campaign goal ($$)
     * pivot charts formatted as line graphs to visualize the relationship

  - 3) explanation of findings based on analysis featuring:
     * concluding results
     * duligence of data set limitations
     * recommendations for supplemental tables and graphs
